zkSync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or
decentralization. Since it's EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring
or re-auditing a single line of code. zkSync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers
write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.

bellman-cuda is a library implementing GPU-accelerated cryptographic functionality for the zkSync prover. 

### Building the library
The library can be built by executing these steps:

#### Initialize git submodules
`git submodule update --init --recursive`
#### Generate the build configuration by executing
`cmake -B./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
#### Build the binary by executing
`cmake --build ./build`

The library binary can be found in the `./build/src` folder. Change the path in the above commands if a different build location is desired.

By default, the library is built for Compute Architecture 8.0.
If a different Compute Architecture is required, the [CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES.html) variables can be set to the desired architecture(s) during the build configuration generation step.

Example for Compute Architecture 8.6: 
```
cmake -B./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86
```

### Executing Tests
By default, the tests binary is not compiled.

This can be changed by setting the variable `BUILD_TESTS` to `ON` in the build configuration step like this:

`cmake -B./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=ON`.

Then, after executing the build step, the tests binary is located in the `./build/tests` folder and can be executed by calling:

`./build/tests/tests`.

## Disclaimer

zkSync Era has been through lots of testing and audits. Although it is live, it is still in alpha state and will go
through more audits and bug bounty programs. We would love to hear our community's thoughts and suggestions about it!
It is important to state that forking it now can potentially lead to missing important security updates, critical
features, and performance improvements.
